# Mario-Kart-Wii-HD-Remaster
Hello, I'm koolkreate one of the many people responsible for managing this project.
To the release section, will be the latest version of the modpack.
What sets this apart from other Mario Kart Wii HD packs?
This pack can run natively on the WII/ WII U and dolphin: So you can enjoy "enhanced" graphics on any platform.
Since the pack is affects the iso directly, it most likely can be used in conjuction with any other texture pack you want (So for dolphin this pack can be used in conjuction with another HD Texture Pack).
Due to this pack being ISO Based, it can be used on dolphin to improve graphics with minimal added lag, since external textures aren't neccesary allowing those with lower end devices to still enjoy MKWII in a true beauty.
Unfortunately, I do not have much time to manage the pack so above are the files, compiled and uncompiled as such if you would like feel free to use / adapt the textures and use them in your own modpacks - or even fork/edit this pack to patch out any bugs you may find.

Updates May Still continue but may lack a frequency.
